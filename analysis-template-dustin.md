| **Step Order** | **Stage Name**             | **Description**                                                                                          | **Purpose**                          | **Example Evidence**                                                                                     |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1              | Introduction and Overview  | Specify the analysis target (e.g., subject, candidate) and briefly describe overall performance (e.g., full score, deductions). | Set the scope and establish an initial impression | "Alright, we’re now analyzing Michael’s Verbal scoresheet" "The math section currently looks like a full score" |
| 2              | Data Cleaning and Anomaly Marking | Identify and filter out invalid data (e.g., guessed or unanswered questions), mark anomalies, and flag uncertainties for confirmation. | Ensure analysis is based on reliable data, avoiding misjudgment | "These questions were likely guessed, so I’ll mark them as invalid" "Unsure if Q17 was guessed"          |
| 3              | Time and Speed Analysis    | Examine solving time (too fast, overtime, normal), assess its impact on performance, and suggest risks or improvements. | Understand time management skills and prepare for timed training | "Q3 and Q4 were done a bit too fast" "About half of the valid data shows overtime"                      |
| 4              | Analysis by Question Type and Difficulty | Sort questions by type (e.g., CR, DST) and difficulty (low, medium, high), analyzing performance (accuracy, weaknesses, timing tendencies). | Pinpoint strengths and weaknesses for tailored suggestions | "Sort by difficulty first, then by question type" "DST seems relatively strong"                         |
| 5              | Detailed Diagnosis and Obstacle Identification | Dive into errors or overtime questions, discuss specific items and related concepts, and ask the candidate to recall obstacles (e.g., concepts, question types). | Identify root causes to ensure effective suggestions | "Q14 was done quickly but carelessly wrong, needs recall" "What’s the concept linked to Q1 and Q20?"     |
| 6              | Strengths/Weaknesses and Reading Ability Assessment | Summarize strengths and weaknesses, evaluate if reading comprehension issues exist (e.g., REAL/PURE, info absorption). | Differentiate technical errors from foundational gaps | "Your strength is likely CSSPS" "Errors aren’t concentrated in PURE or REAL, suggesting no reading issue" |
| 7              | Formulating Suggestions    | Provide practice recommendations: volume (more for weaknesses), difficulty (progressive), timed training (gradual reduction), tools (e.g., recording). | Offer actionable improvement plans to boost efficiency and accuracy | "Practice only high-difficulty questions" "Time limit from 3 to 2 minutes" "OG/OV medium (record and review with video)" |
| 8              | Additional Notes and To-Dos | Highlight key reminders (e.g., avoid guessing, recall obstacles), list items to confirm (e.g., candidate feedback). | Ensure smooth execution of suggestions with room for adjustments | "Next time, make sure to answer everything" "To be determined after your analysis"                      |
